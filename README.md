# programmer-dvorak-normal-keypad

I like [Roland Kaufmann's Programmer Dvorak](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) keyboard layout however I dislike the fact that he reverses the direction of the numeric keypad. This is an installable solution that sort of backtracks from his improvements.

To get an idea, here is a comparison

Kaufman's original layout with "improved" keypad layout

My normal keypad version

If you prefer version, continue on.

##How to use?

1) Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yeokm1/programmer-dvorak-normal-keypad/releases) section.  
2) Download either the "English Singapore" or "English US" version relevant to your operating system Windows/Mac.  
3) Unzip the file  

###Windows
3) Go to Control Panel -> Language  
4) Select your language -> Option -> Add an input method   
5) Search for `Programmer Dvorak - Normal Keypad` and Add. If the new layout is not visible, you may need to reboot your machine and start from Step 3.

###Mac
3) Copy the bundle file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` if you want it to be system wide or `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` if you only want it for the current user.  
4) Go to System Preferences, Keyboards, Input Sources
